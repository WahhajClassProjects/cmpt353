Test Case ID: db_ut_4
Test Case Title: Create New Message
Test Case Description: Test if a new message can be added to the database

Preconditions: 
- Database is running
- Starter test data is in the database

Test Steps:
1. INSERT new message into db: channelID = 4, senderID = 1, timestamp = current unix time,
	parentID = 0, thumbsUp = 2, thumbsDown = 1, body = "inserting a new message"
2. SELECT the message by its id
3. Assert that the returned message has the same values as those in step 1

Expected Results:
- message id > 50 as the starter test data has 50 messages
- Assertion is true 

Postconditions:

Notes: Developer and tester notes
- parentID = 0 means no parent
