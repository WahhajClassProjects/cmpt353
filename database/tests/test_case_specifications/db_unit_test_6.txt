Test Case ID: db_ut_6
Test Case Title: Add Invalid Users
Test Case Description: Test is new users with invalid values can be added

Preconditions: 
- Database is running
- Starter test data has been loaded

Test Steps:
INSERT new users with the follow invalid values. Assert that each insert fail.
1. Invalid id -- user: id = "", password = "abc" name = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 1"
2. Invalid id -- user: id = " ", password = "abc" name = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 2"
3. Invalid id -- user: id = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"(51 a's), password = "abc" name = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 2"
4. Invalid id -- user: id = null, password = "abc" name = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 4"
5. Invalid password -- user: id = "db_ut_6", password = null,  name = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 5"
6. Invalid password -- user: id = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 6", password = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"(101 a's),  name = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 6"
7. Invalid password -- user: id = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 7", password = "",  name = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 7"
8. Invalid password -- user: id = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 8", password = " ",  name = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 8"
9. Invalid name -- user: id = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 9", password = "abc",  name = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"(51 a's)
10. Duplicate id -- user: id = "1", password = "abc" name = "db_ut_6-FAILED-TEST-STEP 10"

Expected Results:
- All inserts should fail 

Postconditions:
- Users table remains unchanged

Notes: Developer and tester notes
