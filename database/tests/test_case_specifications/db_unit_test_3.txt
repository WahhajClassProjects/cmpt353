Test Case ID: db_ut_3
Test Case Title: Create New User
Test Case Description: Test is a new user can be inserted into the users table

Preconditions: 
- database is running

Test Steps:
1. INSERT new user -- id = "db_ut_3-id", password = "newUserPassword", name = "db_ut_3-name"
2. Assert that the INSERT goes through without any errors
3. SELECT * USERS and assert that user from step 1 is in the list with all fields identical to those in step 1
4. INSERT new user -- id = "db_ut_3-id2", password = "newUserPassword", name = null
5. Assert that the INSERT goes through without any errors
6. SELECT * USERS and assert that user from step 4 is in the list with all fields  id = "db_ut_3-id2", password = "newUserPassword", name = "db_ut_3-id2"
7. INSERT new user -- id = "db_ut_3-id2", password = "newUserPassword", name = ""
8. Assert that the INSERT goes through without any errors
9. SELECT * USERS and assert that user from step 4 is in the list with all fields  id = "db_ut_3-id2", password = "newUserPassword", name = "db_ut_3-id2"
10. INSERT new user -- id = "db_ut_3-id2", password = "newUserPassword", name = " "
11. Assert that the INSERT goes through without any errors
12. SELECT * USERS and assert that user from step 4 is in the list with all fields  id = "db_ut_3-id2", password = "newUserPassword", name = "db_ut_3-id2"

Expected Results:
- Assertions are true
- All users are inserted with name = id, if name was not provided

Postconditions:
- New users added to user table

Notes: Developer and tester notes
- If name is empty, then name = id by default
