Test Case ID: db_ut_19
Test Case Title: Side Delete All Messages in Channel
Test Case Description: Test if all messages in a channel are deleted when a channel is deleted

Preconditions: 
- Database is running

Test Steps:
1. Create a new channel to test -- name = "db_ut_19"
2. INSERT some messages
	channelID = id from step 1, senderID = "u1", timestamp = current unix time, parentID = 0, thumbsUp = 0, thumbsDown = 0, body = "db_ut_19-1", deleted = FALSE
	channelID = id from step 1, senderID = "u1", timestamp = current unix time, parentID = 0, thumbsUp = 0, thumbsDown = 0, body = "db_ut_19-2", deleted = FALSE
	channelID = id from step 1, senderID = "u1", timestamp = current unix time, parentID = 0, thumbsUp = 0, thumbsDown = 0, body = "db_ut_19-3", deleted = FALSE
	channelID = id from step 1, senderID = "u1", timestamp = current unix time, parentID = 0, thumbsUp = 0, thumbsDown = 0, body = "db_ut_19-4", deleted = FALSE
	channelID = id from step 1, senderID = "u1", timestamp = current unix time, parentID = 0, thumbsUp = 0, thumbsDown = 0, body = "db_ut_19-5", deleted = FALSE
3. Delete the channel. UPDATE channels SET delete = TRUE WHERE id = id from step 1
4. SELECT * FROM channels WHERE id = id = id from step 1
5. Assert that the deleted field is TRUE
6. SELECT * FROM messages WHERE channelID = id from step 1
7. Assert that the returned messages all have deleted = TRUE
8. SELECT * FROM messages WHERE channelID != id from step 1
9. Assert that the returned messages all have deleted = FALSE

Expected Results:
- The new channel has been deleted
- All messages in the new channel have been deleted
- Messages not in the channel remain untouched

Postconditions:
- Starter test data has not been modified
